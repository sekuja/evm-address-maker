## 📖 Introduction

**EVM Address Maker** is a tool designed to help you generate Ethereum (or other EVM-compatible network) addresses with custom prefixes and/or suffixes. The tool leverages worker threads for parallel processing to accelerate the search.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Custom Address Search**: Find addresses with specific prefixes and/or suffixes.
- **High Efficiency**: Uses multi-threading for faster address generation.
- **Time Feedback**: Displays the time during the search process.
- **User-Friendly**: Configuration via a simple `.env` file.

## 📋 Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version is recommended)
- NPM (Comes bundled with Node.js)

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sekuja/evm-address-maker.git
cd evm-address-maker
```

### Install Dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Set Up `.env` Configuration: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
# Replace '0x00' and '00' with the prefix and suffix you want.
# NUM_THREADS="" comment '#' To use the maximum number of threads (based on CPU cores), keep this line commented.
# If you want to manually set the number of threads, remove the comment '#' and specify the number, e.g., NUM_THREADS="4".

# NUM_THREADS="" # Number of threads to use (default is the number of CPU cores).
PREFIX="0x00" # Example: starts with '0x00'
SUFFIX="00" # Example: ends with '00'
```

### Run the Script: Use the following command to start the search:

```
npm run build
```

## 📊 Output: The tool will search for an address that matches the `.env` configuration. Example output:

```
WSL@DESKTOP:~/evm-address-maker$ npm run build

> evm-address-maker@1.0.3 build
> node src/index.js

Looking for addresses with the prefix "0x00" and the suffix "00" using 8 threads.
Address found!
Address: 0x008CeB3e3f52c7F2724927c40efc5F81Fc501D00
Private Key: 0x4706ee536aff8b4c17efa1bfbbd04a404becba1f28dd31a0579e3f0151072734
WSL@DESKTOP:~/evm-address-maker$
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Security**: Keep your private key secure. Never share it or store it in unsafe locations.
- **Efficiency**: The longer the prefix/suffix, the more time it will take to find a matching address. Use wisely.
- **Multi-threading**: This tool automatically detects the number of CPU cores to determine the number of threads to use. You can also specify the number of threads manually by setting the `NUM_THREADS` variable in the `.env` file.
